Context
=======

Context provides a simple wrapper of
[github.com/gorilla/context](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/context).

It is based on [gorilla.go](https://blog.golang.org/context/gorilla/gorilla.go) in
on a [The Go Blog](https://blog.golang.org/) post,
[Go Concurrency Pattern](https://blog.golang.org/context).

Slight improvement are done to make it better by default.
